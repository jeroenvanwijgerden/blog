Learning to leap over the pitfall of premature implemetation details.

duplicates vs reoccurrences
Not about the elements themselves, but their occurrences
what made me realize this is oac/2016/1/2
if wanted to implement as duplicates, could not be lazy...
unless I would break what I would expect from the function.
Made me realize duplicates was improper abstraction! Too specific! Premature implementation detail!
Why does it matter though?






overcoming the imperative-declarative ambuiguity of English
= always imperative, start name with -> to 'cheat out' a declarative name





The rationale of Uncle Bob's "three lines per function" rule and the two uses of a name.
uses of a name:
- to summarize meaning
- to provide a context for an implementation

I came to realize the second use of a name by this example
<< see cfn/assets, bottom few functions >>

Uncle Bob's "three lines per function" rule supports understandability through brevity.
Minimal irrelevant details = maximal abstraction.
The abstraction is achieved by names.
However,
- These names need not be functions, but can be values also;
- These names need not be introduced outside function scope; let block can be fine.






Why programming is useful and why I love it so much; or: software is an implementation detail.

externalization

Bonus: I love Clojure so much because to me expressing myself in it feels most natural of all programming languages.





What's the benefit of simplicity?

Problem -> solution -> implementation -> test

An implementation is simple when it straightforwardly maps to the problem.

Keeping things simple will allow us realize if what we're doing is actually what we're supposed to be doing.

Being simple is about minimalism; unburden mind as much as possible to we can think of relevant things.
