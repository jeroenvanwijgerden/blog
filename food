Forming healthy eating habits

- what are healthy eating habits?
- how to form them?
  - what are blocking factors?



As I am writing this, about seven years after I first became interested in forming healthy eating habits, I am under the impression that I have formed stable, lasting eating habits that are healthy for me, with little (but definitely some!) room for improvement left.

I hope this report of my experiences will be of some benefit to the reader.


## A little personal history

A few months after I turned 21, I had lived on my own for about 2.5 years and had been training HEMA ('swordfighting') for a year. During a HEMA class we did some wrestling, which ignited my interest, and I promptly switched to most wrestle-y thing I was able to find: japanese jiu jitsu.

I was brought eating mostly the cornerstone and holy trinity of Dutch cuisine: "aardappelen, groenten en vlees" - potatoes, vegetables and meat. Although on occasion I would eat exotic dishes involving rice or pasta, in my world dinner meant PVM. Barring the occasional fastfood, living on my own I prepared nothing but PVM for myself.

Partaking in jiu jitsu I became interested in eastern cultures and bought my first box of rice. A major life improvement had already been no longer peeling potatoes (what a time and cleanup saver!), but rice was even easier to prepare and cheaper to boot. I prepared nothing but RVM for myself.

Remarking on this in some conversation, I was asked if rice is as nutricious as our proud and trusty potatoe. Maybe accidentally my vision had brushed the nutritional facts on food packaging before, but later that day was the first time I deliberately compared the nutritional value of different foods.

Life went on. I started eating different foods but kept the staples: frozen pizza, fries, chips (potatoes!), heaps of bread with peanut butter. I had a freezer for the sole purpose of storing meat so I could buy meat in bulk when it would go on sale. I ate 200 grammes of pork every day. At the time, the two primary virtues of food were deliciousness and affordability.

Still some improvements happened during that period. Giving it my all on the mat twice a week did make we aware of eating enough and on time. Also, after yet another case of pease rolling off my plate, I started to put all my food into one of the pots I would use to cook it and eat from the pot. I started eating more and more* and a single pot could no longer accomodate such volumes. I switched to a type of large stone bowl I still eat all my dinner out of today.

A year had passed since I started jiu jitsu. I fell extremely in love. It was bittersweet. (Strange to so summarize this major episode of my life.) When my mind was finally clear again, it was time to see clear again as well. Standing in the elevator of my appartment building with my new glasses on, my heart dropped. In the mirror thence I saw the horrendous condition of my facial skin. I called my mother and asked her how long it had been this way. "A few years. I thought you knew." I did not have skin issues as a teenager, so I was baffled. A quick search suggested it was my diet, most likely all the pork. I finished

* Stress eating

We do so many things because it is the norm, and we are not aware of it. Like eating off plates.


Healthy for your person
Healthy for the planet
- soy beans, gardener who once planted soybeans but never again. So much effort for so little food. Soy you buy in stores harvested industrially, consuming fossil fuels. Not only that, also has to travel all the way from south america to the netherlands.
The truth of this for soybeans specifically is irrelevant. The message is: There is more to food production than just growign the food. Only looking at growing, meat takes more resources. However, there is also harvesting, cleaning, transport.

Also, many people do not seem to consciously realize the difference between a thing and 'the' industry producing that thing. The vast majority of non-meat eaters say they think meat is bad because the animals are treated terribly, the meat contains hormones or the production of meat produces much waste. But these are all arguments agains a particular way of obtaining meat, 'the' meat industry, not the act of eating meat by itself.

By discussing this with them, many of them agree that eating meat by itself is not necessesarily bad and even perfectly natural, at least for some animals. Some still find that killing an animal when other options are available is immoral, which is a fine opinion to have.

Even with this newfound understanding of the immorality and physical unhealthiness (hormones) of typical supermarket meat, I would still eat such meat. A habit is a force of its own, contesting willpower.

I'm noticing a recurring theme in my writing:
I often describing that you should be able to make a conscious to do something.
I do indeed see this as a great power.
However, not always good: some things should surpass thought altogheter.
Be able to let other systems do their thing without interference, without the consciousness intervening.
Then again, this is 'being able to choose' not to intervene! funny.
So, to nuance: Be able to make something a decision, then make deliberate tradeoffs.
