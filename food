Forming healthy eating habits

- what are healthy eating habits?
- how to form them?
  - what are blocking factors?



As I am writing this, about seven years after I first became interested in forming healthy eating habits, I am under the impression that I have formed stable, lasting eating habits that are healthy for me, with little (but definitely some!) room for improvement left.

I hope this report of my experiences will be of some benefit to the reader.


## A little personal history

A few months after I turned 21, I had lived on my own for about 2.5 years and had been training HEMA ('swordfighting') for a year. During a HEMA class we did some wrestling, which ignited my interest, and I promptly switched to most wrestle-y thing I was able to find: japanese jiu jitsu.

I was brought eating mostly the cornerstone and holy trinity of Dutch cuisine: "aardappelen, groenten en vlees" - potatoes, vegetables and meat. Although on occasion I would eat exotic dishes involving rice or pasta, in my world dinner meant PVM. Barring the occasional fastfood, living on my own I prepared nothing but PVM for myself.

Partaking in jiu jitsu I became interested in eastern cultures and bought my first box of rice. A major life improvement had already been no longer peeling potatoes, but rice was even easier to prepare and cheaper to boot. I prepared nothing but RVM for myself.

Remarking on this in some conversation, I was asked if rice is as nutricious as our proud and trusty potatoe. Maybe accidentally my vision had brushed the nutritional facts on food packaging before, but later that day was the first time I deliberately compared the nutritional value of different foods.

And so it began.

I'm noticing a recurring theme in my writing:
I often describing that you should be able to make a conscious to do something.
I do indeed see this as a great power.
However, not always good: some things should surpass thought altogheter.
Be able to let other systems do their thing without interference, without the consciousness intervening.
Then again, this is 'being able to choose' not to intervene! funny.
So, to nuance: Be able to make something a decision, then make deliberate tradeoffs.
