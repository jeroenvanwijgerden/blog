Science is valuable and often overrated.

## Science is not science
The word 'science' evokes different meaning to different people and therefore ambiguous.
"it's a scientific fact that..." likely the 'fact' they refer to is a conclusion of a research paper that reads something like "there is some evidence that suggests", or "there is no evidence to disprove", or "the hypothesis held for 31 out of 50 test subjects".

### 'Ideal science' vs science in practise
performed by humans
faliable, corruptable, pressure

## To a large degree, science is interpretation

## Science does not have all the answers

"Science is about admitting what we don't know" ~ Matthew McConaughey's character in the movie Interstellar
but often overlooked overlooed by people.

### Misinterpretation of statistics.
"it's scientifically proven" ~ my dad.

The most common fallacy I notice among people with an academic background is that they (subconsciously, perhaps) think statistics can give guarantees for anything outside of the data with which the statistics were derived. Statistics provide an indication of likelihood for similar situations. It is part of the art that is statistics to estimate to which degree situations are similar (often impossible to tell because only some relevant factors are known or presumed to be known) and as such how to inpertred the statistical conslusions. Although in practise statistics often are very effective at predicting outcomes and undoubtedly have merit, too often I get the impression people no longer entertain the possiblity that something outside the statistical likelihood can still occur.
